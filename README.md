  * setup.py
  * README.md

  * movie_trailer

move to one level deeper that is where the setup.py file is in, to cross check whether the path is correct, in command line or command prompt run ls -l command which should show all above mentioned files in the directory with its type and run below commands either

```
python -m movie_trailer
```
 
 or 

```
